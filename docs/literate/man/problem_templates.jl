# # Problem Templates

# We provide a number of problem templates for making it simple and easy to set up and solve certain types of quantum optimal control problems. These templates all construct a `QuantumControlProblem` object.  The problem templates are:

# ## Unitary Smooth Pulse Problem

# ```@docs

# UnitaryBangBangProblem
# ```

# ## Unitary Minimum Time Problem
